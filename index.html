        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Andrew Lee, currently living and studying in Pittsburgh.  I am a full-time student in my second year at the University of Pittsburgh and majoring in Architecture/engineering.  I really like organizing/designing and building/structures stood out to me the most in terms of design.  I was deciding between engineering and architecture for they are two very different but similar majors, so I decided to go for the Architectural Engineering path and am currently working towards that.</p> 

        <p>My family and I live in the suburbs of Havertown, PA with other relatives living across the states and the world.  I would be the oldest and the first first-generation student in my family and my younger sister will be attending Boston University soon as a freshman in college.  I haven’t gone back to Korea, my originate country but would love to go back once I finalize my citizenship here in the U.S.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I really enjoy mingling and talking with friends but if I’m alone I like to just browse videos or listen to and play music.  My favorite thing to do would be just playing guitar and learning new arrangements/songs to pass the time or simply go around cleaning/organizing the house.</p>
